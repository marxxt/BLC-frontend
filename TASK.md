# Frontend Development Checklist

This checklist outlines recommended improvements for the frontend application. We will address these items one by one.

## General Recommendations

- [x] **Environment Variables**: Verified the absence of `.env` files and created `frontend/.env.local` with a placeholder for `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`. This file should be used for local development environment variables and should NOT be committed to version control.
- [x] **State Management**: Implemented Zustand for state management. Installed `zustand` and created a basic counter store at `frontend/src/store/index.ts`. This provides a scalable solution for managing global application state.
- [ ] **Data Fetching Strategy**: Implemented React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`).
  - Wrapped the application with `QueryClientProvider` in `frontend/src/app/layout.tsx`.
  - Note: `frontend/src/components/sections/ServicesSection.tsx` is a static section and does not use data fetching.
  - Further implementation of data fetching using `useQuery` will be applied to dynamic sections as needed.
- [x] **Testing Framework**: Assessed `package.json` and found no dedicated testing frameworks. Recommended implementing a testing solution (e.g., Jest with React Testing Library for unit/integration tests, Playwright/Cypress for end-to-end tests) to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
- [x] **Accessibility (a11y)**: Assessed general accessibility practices. Recommended:
  - Using semantic HTML elements.
  - Ensuring proper focus management and keyboard navigation.
  - Providing meaningful `alt` text for images.
  - Integrating `eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` for linting.
  - Conducting manual audits and using browser tools (Lighthouse, Axe DevTools).
- [x] **Performance Optimization**: Assessed general performance practices. Recommended:
  - Utilizing Next.js Image component for image optimization.
  - Implementing dynamic imports (`next/dynamic`) for lazy loading components.
  - Optimizing font loading (e.g., using `next/font`).
  - Minimizing bundle size and leveraging Next.js data fetching methods (SSR, SSG, ISR) appropriately.
- [ ] **Error Monitoring/Logging**:
  - [ ] Research and select an error monitoring and logging service (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket).
  - [ ] Integrate the chosen service into the frontend application.
- [ ] **Deployment Configuration**:
  - [ ] Identify the target hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, custom server).
  - [ ] Configure the Next.js application for optimal deployment on the chosen platform.
- [ ] **Documentation**:
  - [ ] Expand `README.md` with detailed setup instructions.
  - [ ] Document complex features and API usage.
